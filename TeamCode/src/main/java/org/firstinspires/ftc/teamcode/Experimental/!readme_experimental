Hey there!

This folder is pretty cool. You should put all of your testing classes in here to keep them separate from your main stuff.
Currently all of the classes in this folder are temporarily disabled. Comment out the @Disabled text to enable the class.
Files in here should not be active at all times. You can use the '@Disabled' command before you instantiate the class to prevent it from showing up on the phones.
    Need this an import for it to work! ---> import com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.Disabled;

When testing a class here, make sure to output to your screen the variables you are trying to measure.
Have your gyro print what its position or have your color sensor spit out what it sees.
This will be very useful in determining how you can implement new sensors and how to make the most out of the old ones.

The titles are fairly self explanatory so just mess around with them and see what they do! You will learn a lot from just getting your hands dirty.
