Hey there!

Not much to say about this one but....
This is the folder where all of the code you want to run in a competition should be stored.

My one note that I learned from my last crack at autonomous code is that -- class extensions -- are VERY usefull.
If you look at the 'AutoRedCrypto' and 'AutoVuMarkPathing' code, you will notice they are copies of one another with an adition 10 lines of code.
DON'T DO THAT. A simple solution (that is easier tha copying one class into the other) is to have 'AutoRedCrypto' extend 'AutoVuMarkPathing'.
This gives the new class access to all of the extended class' methods. It will take a little bit of extra work to turn things into methods, but it will be 100times easier to read.
---NOTE--- If you do this, your methods need to be either 'public' or 'protected' and cannot be 'private'.
